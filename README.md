Simulation optimization of inventory management decisions


### Stock optimization
* COO and CFO of the chain of stores turned to you - as the main Data Scientist - with a request to optimize the current stocking system, ie system parameters (s, S).
* The CFO is primarily interested in lowering storage levels, which will reduce the cost of capital tied up in stock, which, given the rising interest rates, is a heavy financial burden for the company.
* The COO wants to at least maintain or further improve customer satisfaction by ensuring a high level of product availability on store shelves
